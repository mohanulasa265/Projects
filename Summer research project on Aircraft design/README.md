# Summer Research Project: Aircraft Design and RC Plane Prototype

This repository contains my summer research project on aircraft design, where I worked on designing and building a fixed wing RC aircraft prototype. This project was not just about making a model, but about understanding how an aircraft is actually designed by applying engineering concepts and turning them into a real structure and physical prototype. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## My journey

From childhood, I was always fascinated by flights and I have always been an aviation enthusiast. I used to admire aircraft from the outside, but this project introduced me to what happens behind the scenes and how an aircraft is designed using concepts from aerodynamics, stability, and structural design.

For some, a project like this may look like a hobby build, but for me it was something I was deeply passionate about. Instead of looking at it only as a hobby project, I took it seriously, studied the concepts in depth, and applied them carefully while designing the aircraft and creating the prototype.

Most of my days during this project were spent learning new concepts and improving my understanding. The time available for manufacturing was limited, so the work had to be planned properly and executed within a short span.

## What this project is about

The main idea behind this project was to design and develop a fixed wing RC aircraft model with a structured approach. The design was inspired by the Cessna 172R type configuration and the goal was to build a lightweight prototype that can eventually be taken to a complete flight ready stage. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Even though the aircraft did not take off during this phase, the complete process of conceptual design, prototype building, and testing gave me a clear understanding of what goes into designing an aircraft.

## What this repository contains

This repository includes the work and supporting material from the project, including:
- The final project report
- Initial design calculations and supporting notes
- CAD models and design layouts
- Prototype development work and images
- Manufacturing progress and structural assembly details :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Tools and skills I used

During the project, I explored and applied multiple engineering tools and skills, including:
- CAD modelling for aircraft geometry and structure
- Prototyping and fabrication methods
- Additive manufacturing (3D printing) for making components
- Laser cutting for structural parts
- Material selection based on strength to weight ratio and cost considerations :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Challenges faced

One of the toughest parts of the project was material selection. The aircraft structure had to be strong but also lightweight, and at the same time the cost and availability of materials also mattered. Since the time to continue manufacturing was limited, I had to make decisions quickly, and this project taught me why choosing materials carefully is extremely important.

## Learnings from the project

This project taught me a lot, both technically and personally. I learned that aircraft design is not just about calculations, but about testing, building, observing issues, improving the design, and repeating the process until it works.

The most important learning for me was that even if something does not work perfectly in the first attempt, the process itself builds strong understanding. Even though the prototype did not take off yet, I learned a lot through the conceptual design and testing phase, and I hope that one day I will make it fly.

This project also helped me realize what my real interests are and where I would like to head in the future.

## Acknowledgement

I would like to sincerely thank Prof. Sumit Tambe for giving me this wonderful opportunity to work on this project. His guidance and support helped me throughout the project and made this experience truly valuable.
