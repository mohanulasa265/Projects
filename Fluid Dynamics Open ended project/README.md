This video shows the experiment demonstration and the working of the wind turbine setup used to perform useful work by lifting a small mass through a pulley arrangement.

## Project overview

The goal of this project was to design a small-scale horizontal axis wind turbine and demonstrate useful mechanical work output using a pulley-mass system. The main performance comparison was done by testing blades with two different pitch angles:
- 3 degree pitch angle blades
- 30 degree pitch angle blades

The turbine blades were 3D printed and mounted on a rotating shaft supported using ball bearings to reduce friction.

## Experimental setup (brief)

A tabletop fan was used to generate wind flow for testing at two different wind speeds. The turbine was connected to a pulley system with a suspended mass. As the turbine rotates, the string winds up on the pulley and lifts the mass vertically.

Key setup details used in calculations:
- Mass lifted: 18 g
- Lift height: 0.75 m
- Pulley radius: 1 cm

## Key results and observation summary

- The 30 degree pitch angle blades performed significantly better for the available wind speeds.
- The 3 degree pitch angle blade setup was unable to lift the mass at lower wind speed, and performed weakly compared to the 30 degree design.
- Efficiency and tip speed ratio were calculated for both blade designs at the tested wind speeds.
- The measured tip speed ratios were below the typical optimal range for horizontal axis wind turbines, which contributed to lower power coefficients in this small-scale setup.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates that blade pitch angle has a strong effect on the ability of a mini wind turbine to generate enough torque to do useful work. Under the given test conditions and wind speeds, the 30 degree pitch blade design gave better lift and torque performance compared to the 3 degree pitch design.
