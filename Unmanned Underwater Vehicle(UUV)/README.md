# Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) Hull Design Project

This repository contains our work from the undergraduate project course on an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV), carried out under the guidance of Prof. Vinod Narayanan and Prof. Atul Bhargav.

The overall project involved developing a functional underwater vehicle, and our specific responsibility in the team was focused on the hull design from a structural and safety perspective.

## Our team contribution

Our part of the project was mainly focused on two critical aspects:

1. Structural design of the hull
We worked on designing the hull body such that it can withstand underwater pressure without failure. This included the initial structural calculations and pressure-related analysis needed to validate the design.

2. Leakage prevention and sealing
Preventing leakage was one of the most important requirements of the hull. We worked on identifying possible leakage paths, improving sealing methods, and validating the hull for water tightness through testing.

These videos demonstrate the physical testing of the hull, including validation of sealing and water leakage prevention under real conditions.

## Project summary

The UUV hull was designed to provide structural integrity, protect internal components from external water pressure, and ensure a sealed environment for underwater operation. Along with structural strength, the ability to prevent leaks consistently was treated as a primary requirement since even minor leakage can lead to failure of internal electronics and loss of mission capability.

## Learnings

This was our first major undergraduate project where we got to apply engineering concepts in a real-world setting. We did not just stop at calculations, but also built and tested the system, made mistakes, identified issues, and improved the design based on what we observed.

Through this project we learned:
- How underwater pressure conditions influence structural design decisions
- Why leakage prevention is a critical design requirement in underwater systems
- How practical testing can reveal issues that are not obvious during initial design
- The importance of iteration and refinement based on test results
- How to work as a team and integrate multiple subsystems into a single design
