# Machine Learning Projects

This folder contains three assignments that I completed as part of the course Machine Learning (ES335).  
These assignments were done as a group of three people. Each assignment includes the code files and related work done during the course.

## Assignment 1
Folder name: es335-25-fall-assignment-1  
This assignment includes the first set of problems and implementation tasks from the course.

## Assignment 2
Folder name: es335-assignment2  
This assignment contains the second assignment work, focusing on more machine learning concepts and practice problems.

## Assignment 3
Folder name: ES335---Assignment-3  
This assignment contains the third assignment work, including further implementation and analysis tasks from the course.

## Notes
All three assignments are organized as separate folders inside Machine Learning Projects.
