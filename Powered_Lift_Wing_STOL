This project documents the aerodynamic design and analysis of a powered-lift wing
developed under the LAT Aerospace High-Preparation Problem Statement for the
Inter IIT Tech Meet 14.0.

The objective was to achieve Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) capability at low
freestream velocities by employing an externally blown flap configuration integrated
with distributed electric propulsion.

The work includes analytical sizing using semi-empirical powered-lift theory,
airfoil selection at low Reynolds numbers, and high-fidelity CFD validation of
lift augmentation, slipstream–flap interaction, and flow physics.
